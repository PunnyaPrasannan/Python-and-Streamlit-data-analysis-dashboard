# Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard created using **Streamlit**, a powerful Python library for building interactive web applications. The dashboard allows users to upload raw sales data, visualize trends, and perform data analysis interactively. Leveraging **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Plotly** for data visualization.
## Features

1. **Interactive Plots**: Use Plotly to create dynamic and interactive plots directly within the Streamlit environment.
2. **Data Upload and Navigation**: Easily upload and navigate through raw data directly in the dashboard.
3. **Customizable Titles and Headings**: Add titles, headings, headers, and subheaders to organize content clearly.
4. **Segmented Plot Areas**: Generate segments within the dashboard to display multiple plots and analyses.
5. **Date Picker**: Incorporate a date picker to filter data by specific timeframes.
6. **Data Handling and Transformation**: Utilize Python Pandas for efficient data handling and transformation.
7. **Side Pane with Filters**: Use a side pane with multiple select filters for customized data views.
8. **Hierarchical Sales View**: Create a TreeMap for a hierarchical visualization of sales data.
9. **Data Tables**: Generate data tables using Plotly's Figure Factory for a structured view of data.
10. **Styled Data**: Apply styles to data frames for better readability and presentation.
11. **Data Download Options**: View and download data subsets based on plots and filters.
12. **Time Series Analysis**: Perform and visualize time series analysis on sales data.


## Data Upload

The dashboard allows users to upload raw sales data in CSV format. To upload your data:

1. Click on the "Upload Data" button in the sidebar.
2. Select your CSV file from your local system.
3. The dashboard will automatically process and display the data.

## Dashboard Functionality

The dashboard provides a wide range of functionalities for data analysis:

- **Interactive Filtering**: Use the side pane filters to select specific products, regions, or sales teams.
- **Date Filtering**: Use the date picker to analyze sales over specific time periods.
- **Dynamic Segments**: View multiple data segments and plots, such as sales by region, product category, and time.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Visualize trends and patterns over time to forecast future sales.

## Visualization

All visualizations are created using **Plotly**, providing interactive charts and graphs directly within the Streamlit environment. The dashboard includes various plot types:

- **Line Charts**: For visualizing sales trends over time.
- **Bar Charts**: To compare sales across different categories or regions.
- **TreeMaps**: For hierarchical data visualization, showing sales breakdowns.
- **Scatter Plots**: To analyze the relationship between two variables.
- **Data Tables**: Structured views of raw and processed data, created using Plotly Figure Factory.

## Usage

- **Upload Data**: Upload your sales CSV file to begin the analysis.
- **Customize View**: Use the sidebar filters to customize data views based on your analysis needs.
- **Analyze and Download**: View interactive plots and download data for further analysis.
